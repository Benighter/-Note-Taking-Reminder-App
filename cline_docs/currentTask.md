## Current Objectives

- Implement the reminder feature.
- Design the reminder page to show all notes with reminders, sorted by priority and date/time.

## Context

- The `ReminderService` has been updated to use the correct URL (`http://localhost:3001/api`).
- The server is running on port `3001` and the `Note` model is set up correctly.
- The `noteRoutes.js` and `noteController.js` files are in place to handle the `/notes/with-reminders` endpoint.

## Next Steps

1. Verify that the server is correctly fetching notes with reminders.
2. Ensure that the `ReminderListComponent` is displaying the notes correctly.
3. Test the reminder feature to ensure it works as expected.
